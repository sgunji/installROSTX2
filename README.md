# installROSTX2
Install Robot Operating System (ROS) on NVIDIA Jetson TX2

These scripts will install Robot Operating System (ROS) on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development kit.

For L4T 32.1 (JetPack 4.2)

See releases or tags for earlier versions.

The script is based on the Ubuntu ARM install of ROS Kinetic: http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu

Maintainer of ARM builds for ROS is http://answers.ros.org/users/1034/ahendrix/

Based on  installROSTX2 by jetsonhacks(https://github.com/jetsonhacks/installROSTX2)

There are two scripts:

<strong>installROS.sh</strong>
<pre>
Usage: ./installROS.sh  [[-p package] | [-h]]
 -p | --package &lt;packagename&gt;  ROS package to install
                               Multiple Usage allowed
                               The first package should be a base package. One of the following:
                                 ros-melodic-ros-base
                                 ros-melodic-desktop
                                 ros-melodic-desktop-full
 </pre>
 
Default is ros-melodic-ros-base if no packages are specified.

Example Usage:

$ ./installROS.sh -p ros-melodic-desktop -p ros-melodic-rgbd-launch

This script installs a baseline ROS environment. There are several tasks:

<ul>
<li>Enable repositories universe, multiverse, and restricted</li>
<li>Adds the ROS sources list</li>
<li>Sets the needed keys</li>
<li>Loads specified ROS packages, defaults to ros-melodic-base-ros if none specified</li>
<li>Initializes rosdep</li>
</ul>

You can edit this file to add the ROS packages for your application. 

<strong>setupCatkinWorkspace.sh</strong>
Usage:

$ ./setupCatkinWorkspace.sh [optionalWorkspaceName]

where optionalWorkspaceName is the name of the workspace to be used. The default workspace name is catkin_ws. This script also sets up some ROS environment variables. Refer to the script for details.
